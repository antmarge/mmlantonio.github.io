{"name":"Bioinformatics Projects","tagline":"by Margaret Antonio","body":"###A Bioinformatics Conversion Story\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2014, I was an intern in a stem cell lab in Minnesota. For 40-60 hours a week that summer I labored over tweaking each variable of a stubborn PCR experiment and keeping my finicky cells alive through regular checkups and feedings (weekends included). That summer I learned that research demands rigorous dedication and critical thinking. As scientists, we always have to think of the next step to take, not just in an experiment, but also in our careers. Just as we have to be perceptive about what temperature the cells need to be at or when it's time to feed them, so we also have to be perceptive about what the world needs from scientists and what we have to offer to meet those needs. Aristotle sums it up quite well: > \"Where your talents and the world's needs meet, therein lies your vocation.\" \r\nIt was during that summer of countless blank gels and relentless cell deaths that I saw an intersection coming up in my path.\r\n\r\nThe whole lab was gathered in a conference room for our weekly lab meeting. I had my pocket-sized notebook and pen ready at my left and my coffee at my right. The notebook was for all the terms people used that I didn't understand and the coffee was to stay awake amidst the culmination of the most potent soporific conditions: post-lunch, early afternoon, humming sound of air conditioner, and information overload. (I have a tendency to lapse into a hypnagogic state when I feel my intellectual capacities are unable to cope with such situations...I think it's my way of acknowledging my limitations and conserving energy for more realistic endeavors). Unfortunately, I had failed to begin administration of the necessary  caffeine dosages prior to the start of the meeting. I was quickly drifting off into the hypnagogic state. The remarkable thing is that when I undergo this experience of sleep induction, there are certain and few odd things that can snap me out of it. Cheesecake, for example. \r\n\r\nBack to the lab meeting: I was ready to leave my conscious state when I heard the words, \"...R...need...programming...someone...do\". \r\n\r\nI don't even remember what the complete sentence was. I only remember my translated version: \"The world needs someone who can do R programming. Can my talents meet that need?\" I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to compare this to a religious call, such as that of the Old Testament Jacob who was awoken from his slumber by the sound of God's voice calling him. Nevertheless, it was a significant moment in my career trajectory and one that I could not possibly imagine based on previous experiences. I had never even seen a line of code or known anyone who did programming. I became obsessed about this \"need\" of which I knew nothing. I asked every postdoc and grad student I encountered about what they thought about bioinformatics, programming, and the such in relation to biological data analysis. \r\n\r\nWhen I left the land of Vikings for the city of revolutionaries, I had the idea that I would take an introductory class in programming (perhaps the idea resulted from a complex mixture of adventurous Vikings and radical patriot influences). Despite my conscious awkwardness of being a female junior with no coding experience in a class full of freshmen guys, many who programmed in high school, I somehow managed to fall in love. The movies tell it how it is: awkward people can fall in love in awkward circumstances at awkward times. (I understand that \"awkward\" is on the list of words misused by Generation Y, so I promise to only use it one more time). I loved coding, perhaps more than memorizing the Krebs cycle or learning about the role of bcl-2 proteins in apoptosis.  I still like biology, there's not doubt about that. A marriage to biology and an affair with computer science seemed odd. If I liked biology and computer science, couldn't I merge the two? The answer was simple: the interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics was already alive and running. \r\n\r\nOver a year, two substantial computational research projects, several bioinformatics presentations, and 4 more programming languages later, I like to think that I found the intersection. Intersections, however, are rarely destinations in life's path. At present, there is a great need for programming biologists in the burgeoning fields of genomics and genetics. There was a time when computational scientists invented algorithms for data that wasn't even available yet. Today, the advent of high-throughput technologies and sequencing dumps a massive amount of data into the research community---data that if we only have the time and potential to tap into holds a wealth of information about the human genome, diseases, microbes, and more. Perhaps, the next decade will raise a new challenge for scientists to conquer. Perhaps all that blog about N Reasons Not to do a PhD in Bioinformatics is right after all. Perhaps the computer for biologists today is really just like what molecular biology was for biologists in the 80s. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps...it is. However, that's why scientists need to stay alert and perceptive to their needs and the needs of those around them. Knowing which step to take next takes thorough research and a perceptive mind. >We never know when we'll catch a glimpse of the next intersection ahead. \r\nIt could even be when we're at our lowest, in an under-caffeinated state, ready to succumb to the power of the soporific in a lab meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
